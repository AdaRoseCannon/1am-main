## Tips

Some ideas:

* Generate an ssh key on your local machine and use ssh-copy-id so you can log in without entering your password.
* Host some files, to do that put the files in: `~/public_html`
* Send some internal mail `echo "Hi ada" | mail ada`, or use `mutt` to read or send mail.
* Check your disk quota `quota -s`
