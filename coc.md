===============

#### Social

This hosting community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of members of the community or of the wider community in general, in any form. If in violation of this code of conduct we will remove you from the service.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact me via codeofconduct@ada.is

#### Technical

 * Do NOT use Appcache
 * If you use Service worker - Scope it to your path or higher e.g. /~ada/
 * Local Storage - use sensible keys e.g. `ada-access-time` rather than `t` or `time`
 * Cookies - Define the path
 * Building on the server is encouraged but please bare in mind you are sharing it with regards to cpu usage.

A rule of thumb is think carefully when doing something which could potentially affect users on the same domain.
